To run this program, you need a file named "your_data.py".
In that file you need 4 constants: MY_LAT, MY_LONG, MY_EMAIL, MY_PASSWORD.
You have to provide your latitude and longitude, and your email (gmail) and password.
When this program runs, it checks every 60 seconds if the position of the ISS (International Space Station) is around your position, and if it's dark enough to see that. When the conditions met, you will get an email reminder, to look up in the sky.
