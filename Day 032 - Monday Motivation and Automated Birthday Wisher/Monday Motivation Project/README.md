To run this program, you need a file named "email_data.py".
In that file you need 3 constants: USERNAME, PASSWORD, EMAIL_TO.
USERNAME is your email (in this case, a gmail),
PASSWORD is your actual password (or you can create a key for this app in your email settings),
EMAIL_TO is the address of the recipient of the email.
