For this app, you will need a file named "email_data.py".
In that file, you will need 2 constants: USERNAME, PASSWORD.
USERNAME is your email username (in this case, gmail),
PASSWORD is your actual password (or you can create a key for this app in your email settings).
You will also need to fill in the "birthdays.csv" file as the example shows.
